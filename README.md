# Student Registration Form Using Spring Boot with React and Tailwind CSS

This is a full-stack web application built with Spring Boot for the back end and React with Tailwind CSS for the front end. It provides CRUD (Create, Retrieve, Update, Delete) functionality for managing student registrations in a MySQL database. The application demonstrates how to perform RESTful web service operations.

## Features

- **Create:** Add new student registrations with relevant details.
- **Retrieve:** Fetch student information from the database.
- **Update:** Modify existing student records.
- **Delete:** Remove student records from the system.
- **Search:** Find students by various criteria using a search feature.

## Technologies Used

- **Spring Boot:** Back-end framework for building RESTful APIs.
- **React:** Front-end library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS:** A utility-first CSS framework for styling.
- **MySQL:** Relational database system for data storage.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Node.js and npm
- MySQL database server

## Getting Started

### Back-End (Spring Boot)

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/StudentRegistrationSpringBoot.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the `backend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd backend
   ```

3. Configure your MySQL database settings in `src/main/resources/application.properties`.

4. Run the Spring Boot application:

   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   The back end should now be running on `http://localhost:8080`.

### Front-End (React with Tailwind CSS)

1. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   ```

2. Install dependencies:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Start the React development server:

   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

   The front end should now be accessible at `http://localhost:3000`.

## Usage

- Access the web application at `http://localhost:3000` in your browser.
- Use the user interface to perform CRUD operations on student registrations.
- Utilize the search feature to find specific students based on various criteria.
